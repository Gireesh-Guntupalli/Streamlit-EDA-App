This is a simple EDA app which can be used to perform Explorartory Data Analysis on your csv data. 
This application helps you in understanding the data and analyzing the relationship among variables. 
This app also, allows you to drop columns that are not needed after the analysis.

### This app is build using Streamlit and Pandas Profiling Report.
The pandas profiling report is composed of three components Overview, Warnings and Reproduction. 
The Overview section gives the statistics of the data. This section shows the variables, total number of obeservations, missing and duplicate vales of the data.
The warnings tab contains all warnings relating to cardinality, correlation with other variables, missing values, zeroes, variable skewness, and many others.
The reproduction tab just provides report generation information. It displays the start and finish times of the analysis, the time required to compile the report, the pandas profiling software version, and a configuration download option.
