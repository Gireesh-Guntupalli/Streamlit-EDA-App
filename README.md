The pandas profiling report is composed of three components Overview, Warnings and Reproduction. 
The Overview section gives the statistics of the data. This section shows the variables, total number of obeservations, missing and duplicate vales of the data.
The warnings tab contains all warnings relating to cardinality, correlation with other variables, missing values, zeroes, variable skewness, and many others.
The reproduction tab just provides report generation information. It displays the start and finish times of the analysis, the time required to compile the report, the pandas profiling software version, and a configuration download option.
